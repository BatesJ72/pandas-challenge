## The Heroes of Pymoli

This repository contains one major project for the UTBootCamp: An analysis of gaming data for The Heroes of Pymoli.

The code analyzes who is playing the game (age, gender) and what they purchase (analyzed by age, gender, and item purchased).

There is a resources file that has the actual data, and an analysis file that describes three trends I found from the analysis.
